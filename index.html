    Javascript : The Genesis. 

        Javascript is a programming language that is used to implement certain features into a website in order to make it interactive.
        It is easy to learn. 

    Ways to include Javascript into your project. 
        1. internal Javascript : This is done inside a <script></script> which is usually placed at the bottom part of the body. 
        2. external Javascript : This is done in a different file saved with ".js" and then linked to the html file by the <script src=""></script>

    Variables 
        A variable is a container or memory space that is used to hold values. 
        The datatype of a variable can be changed.
    
    Types of Variables 
        - var 
        - let 
        - const 

    Identifiers 
        An identifier is a unique name that is given to a variable. 
        It must not be repeated 
        It must not begin with a number 
        It must not be a Javascript keyword 
        Javascript is very case sensitive. 

    DataType 
        A datatype is the kind or type of value stored in a variable. 
        Examples : 
            string : Anthing that is inside quotes.
                Adding a string and a number will join them together. 
                No mathematical operation takes place inside a string. 
            Number 
            Boolean : This is a datatype that returns only two values, True or False. 
            Null 
            Undefined 
            Object 
     
    Javascript Display Possibilities 
        Where do you want to see your value? 
        - console.log() 
        - alert()
        - document.write 
        - innerHTML, innerText or textContent > they are used to pass values into html elements.  -->

    Javascript Operators 
        - Assignment Operator : This is used to assign value to a variable (=)
        - Arithmetic Operator : used for mathematical operations 
            + 
            - 
            * 
            / 
            % - modulo or remainder 
            ** - exponential or raise to power
            ++ - increment or add one 
            -- - decrement 

        - Comparison Operator 
            < 
            > 
            <= 
            >= 
            == equal to
            === strict equal to 
            != not equal to 
            !== strict not equal to

            Conditional Statements 
                They are used to run a particular code based on the outcome of a condition (if it's true or false)
                1. if and else 
                2. switch statement

        - Logical 
            && and 
            || or 
            ! not


        - Tenary 
            A shorter way of writing if and else. 
            ? - if 
            : - else 

        - Concatinator Operator : used to join strings together or strings and number together (+)
